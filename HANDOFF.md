# HANDOFF — 2026-07-06

## This Session
- Done:
  - Read and parsed `Research Engine Prompt1.MD`.
  - Loaded reference/skills/catalog/agents per CLAUDE.md v12.
  - Researched current open-source patterns for research agents, browser automation, and multi-agent orchestration.
  - Used the `planner` agent to produce `docs/plan/master_plan.md`.
  - Created full project directory tree and Phase 0 scaffold (README, HANDOFF, .gitignore, pyproject.toml, routers, eval harness skeleton, GitHub templates).
  - Fixed `router_sim.py` keyword matching and added a load table to `research-engine-router.md` so all `.claude/router_eval/` self-checks pass.
  - Initialized GitHub repo `isaac233/Research-Engine`, opened Pull Request #1, merged it to `main`, and deleted the feature branch.
  - Amended `docs/plan/master_plan.md` to require a consuming-project `Research/` folder with per-campaign sub-folders and differentiated `<campaign>_Insights.MD` files plus an aggregated `Research/Insights.MD`; merged via PR #3.
  - Implemented Phase 1: core orchestrator + model-agnostic LLM layer.
    - `src/research_engine/state.py`: immutable `ResearchRequest`/`Campaign` dataclasses + SQLite append-only store.
    - `src/research_engine/events.py`: append-only event bus.
    - `src/research_engine/llm/`: `LLMProvider` ABC, `OllamaClient`, `AnthropicClient`, `ModelRegistry`.
    - `src/research_engine/orchestrator.py`: campaign lifecycle state machine with pause/resume/kill.
    - `src/research_engine/monitoring/telemetry.py`: sanitized stage telemetry.
    - `src/research_engine/main.py`: `research-engine run/status/pause/resume/kill` CLI.
    - `src/research_engine/config.py`: project path resolution (including `Research/` layout).
    - Tests: 21 unit/integration tests, 80% coverage.
  - Implemented Phase 2: AI-only browser subsystem.
    - `src/research_engine/browser/ai_browser.py`: `AIBrowser` ABC, `BrowserAction`, `BrowserResult`, `BrowserActionType` enum.
    - `src/research_engine/browser/cdp_driver.py`: Playwright/Chromium driver with policy + robots.txt guards.
    - `src/research_engine/browser/raw_http.py`: pooled httpx client with retries, backoff, jitter, header rotation.
    - `src/research_engine/browser/policy.py`: SSRF/ethical URL policy (private IP, localhost, file:// block).
    - `src/research_engine/browser/robots.py`: per-host robots.txt fetcher/cache.
    - `src/research_engine/browser/fingerprint.py`: legitimate header/viewport rotation.
    - `src/research_engine/browser/graphql_client.py`: GraphQL-aware POST helper.
    - `src/research_engine/browser/unblock_probe.py`: browser-based unblocking research probe; never reports "no solution" without an evidence log.
    - `src/research_engine/orchestrator.py`: blocker detection + unblocking campaign dispatch during discovery.
    - `src/research_engine/main.py`: wires `UnblockProbe` as the default browser.
    - Tests: 38 new browser unit tests, total 59 tests, 80% coverage.
  - Implemented Phase 3: discovery + academic search.
    - `src/research_engine/discovery/schema.py`: normalized `Paper`, `SourceQuery`, `SearchResult`, `DuplicateGroup`, `ResolveResult`, `DiscoveryResult` dataclasses.
    - `src/research_engine/discovery/query_planner.py`: decomposes a request into source-specific `SourceQuery` objects.
    - `src/research_engine/discovery/sources/base.py`: `SourceAdapter` ABC.
    - `src/research_engine/discovery/sources/semantic_scholar.py`, `crossref.py`, `arxiv.py`, `openalex.py`, `serp.py`, `web_crawl.py`: academic + web source adapters.
    - `src/research_engine/discovery/dedup.py`: DOI/URL exact match + title fuzzy deduplication with different-DOI guard.
    - `src/research_engine/discovery/snowball.py`: forward/backward citation expansion via source adapters.
    - `src/research_engine/discovery/resolver.py`: full-text resolution through pdf_url, arXiv, Unpaywall, and DOI landing page; never paywalls.
    - `src/research_engine/discovery/source_registry.py`: builds and dispatches adapters by source name.
    - `src/research_engine/discovery/pipeline.py`: end-to-end `DiscoveryPipeline` (plan → search → dedup → snowball → resolve).
    - `src/research_engine/orchestrator.py`: `DISCOVER` stage runs `DiscoveryPipeline`; unblocking campaigns still dispatch browser probe.
    - `src/research_engine/main.py`: constructs `SourceRegistry` + `DiscoveryPipeline` and passes to `Orchestrator`.
    - `pyproject.toml`: added `feedparser>=6.0` dependency.
    - Tests: 56 new discovery unit tests, total 115 tests, 86% coverage.
  - Updated routers with Phase 3 keyword rows and R013–R019 learned-route deltas in `.claude/research-engine-routes.md`.
  - Updated `.claude/agents/discovery-router.md` keyword table for pipeline, schema, registry, orchestrator integration, and main.py.
- Open:
  - Implement Phase 4: screening + structured extraction.
  - Validate local model stack (Ollama + Gemma/Qwen-class) for planner/screening workloads.
- Blocked: none.
- Risks:
  - Ethical/legal boundary for "advanced penetration techniques" must remain pinned to authorized/defensive/public-only scope as browser capabilities grow.
  - Local model capability assumption (Gemma/Qwen-class) must be validated during Phase 4 screening/extraction.
  - Unblocking campaigns must not drift into gray-area sources; the SSRF/robots.txt policy is the guardrail.

## State of the Build
- Phase: 3 (complete; PR #9 open)
- Last passing commit: `18b4826`
- Last PR: #9 (Phase 3 discovery + academic search) — https://github.com/isaac233/Research-Engine/pull/9

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Implement Phase 4: screening + structured extraction.
2. Validate local model stack (Ollama + Gemma/Qwen-class) for planner/screening workloads.
3. Continue adversarial review of browser policy and unblocking flow.

## Decisions / Assumptions
- ADR-001: Python 3.12+ primary; SQLite for state, DuckDB for corpora.
- ADR-002: Port router/eval pattern from Financial Model Training Data.
- Load-bearing assumption: local models can drive deterministic discovery/screening with adversarial oversight.

## Notes for Next Agent
- All routers live under `.claude/agents/` and learned routes under `.claude/research-engine-routes.md`.
- The eval harness under `.claude/router_eval/` must remain isolated from `src/`.
- `scripts/end_session.py` is a stub; do not run it for real until Phase 9.
- The `Research/` folder layout is documented in `docs/plan/master_plan.md` section 4.13 and implemented in `src/research_engine/config.py`.
- Discovery subsystem is fully wired into the orchestrator; start Phase 4 with `screening/criteria.py` and `screening/ranker.py`.
